# DAG-Guided-Mediation-Analysis
The OrdinalEffectsSport project on GitHub is dedicated to analyzing ordinal effects within the sports field. This project offers a comprehensive suite of tools and methodologies designed for studying and modeling causal effects in sports competition outcomes. Using R language, the project leverages various statistical techniques, including Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and mediation analysis, to explore how different factors contribute to sports results. The code is developed to facilitate in-depth exploration of ordinal data in sports, enabling users to conduct robust causal inference and interpret the underlying mechanisms affecting performance.  
This repository serves as a valuable resource for researchers and analysts seeking to apply advanced R-based techniques to sports-related data.
